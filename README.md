# The Gemini Guide
A collection of example code, prompts, and guides for the Gemini API. You'll need a Gemini API key to run these examples. You can create one in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) with a single click. 

The quickstarts folder contains simple examples that show you how to write your first prompt. You can also find getting started guides that show you the capabilities of the API.

The examples folder has a mix of inspirational examples and practical utilities.

Many examples are written in Python as Jupyter Notebooks. You can open these in [Google Colab](https://https://colab.research.google.com/) by clicking on the "Run in Colab" button near the top of each one.

Contributions are welcome. You can find our contribution guidelines here: TODO. 

You can find more docs at [ai.google.dev](https://ai.google.dev).
