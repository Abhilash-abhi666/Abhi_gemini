# Welcome to the Gemini API Cookbook

This is a collection of guides and examples for the Gemini API. You'll need a Gemini API key to run these examples. You can [create](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) one in Google AI Studio with a single click.

Here's an overview of what you'll find.
* A short [getting started](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/Getting_started.md) guide for building with Gemini API.
* [Quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts) tutorials for writing prompts and using different features of the API.
* [Examples](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/tree/main/examples) of things you can build with the API.

Most of these examples are written in Python as Colab Notebooks. You can open these in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by clicking on the "Run in Colab" button at the top of each notebook, or download and run them in the environment of your choice.
