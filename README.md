# The Gemini Guide
A collection of example code, prompts, and guides for the Gemini API. You'll need a Gemini API key to run these examples. You can create one in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) with a single click. 

The quickstarts folder contains simple examples that show you how to write your first prompt, and  getting started guides that show you the capabilities of the API. The examples folder contains a mix of inspirational examples and practical utilities.

All of these examples are written in Python, and most are Jupyter Notebooks. You can open these in [Google Colab](https://https://colab.research.google.com/) by clicking on the "Run in Colab" button at the top of each notebook.

Looking for examples in other programming languages?
* Node.js and Web (TODO)
