# Welcome to the Gemini API Cookbook
A collection of guides and examples for the Gemini API. You'll need a Gemini API key to run these examples. You can create one in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) with a single click. 

Here's an overview of what you'll find.

* [Docs](foo) contains an API Overview, the API Reference, and best practice guides (on prompting, safety, tuning, etc).
* [Examples](foo) contains a mix of fun examples and practical utilities.

Inside the examples folder, you'll also find:
* [Quickstarts](foo): simple examples of making your first prompt.
* [Capabilities](foo): complete complete code examples that show you how to use different features of the API.
    
All of these examples are written in Python, and most are Jupyter Notebooks. You can open these in [Google Colab](https://https://colab.research.google.com/) by clicking on the "Run in Colab" button at the top of each notebook, or run them in the environment of your choice.

Looking for examples in other programming languages? You can find them in the official SDKs.
* Node.js 
* Dart (Flutter)
* Android
* Swift

Contributions are welcome. You can find our contribution guidelines here: TODO.
