# Get started with the Gemini API
The Gemini API gives you access to Gemini [models](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini) created by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction). Gemini models are built from the ground up to be multimodal, so you can reason seamlessly across text, images, and code. You can use these to develop an extraordinary range of applications.

**Start developing**
The fastest and easiest way to get started is to try a [quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts) tutorial.  
* Start with [prompting](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Prompting.ipynb) to make your first API calls, including prompts that work with text and images.
* Explore API capabilities by checking out the quickstarts for [safety](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Safety.ipynb), [embeddings](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Embeddings.ipynb), [tuning](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Tuning.ipynb), and [function calling](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Function_calling.ipynb). 

**Try models in your browser**
Experiment with Gemini models and prototype prompts using [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/). Google AI Studio has more features, too:
* Use it to [create](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) your API key
* You can use it to [tune](https://aistudio.google.com/app/tuned_models/new_tuned_model) models .

**Official SDKs**
The Gemini API is a REST API. You can call the API using a command line tool like cURL ([example](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/curl/rest_prompting.ipynb)), or by using one of our official SDKs:
* [Python](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-python) (start with a [quickstart](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-api-cookbook/tree/main/quickstarts) tutorial)
* [Node.js](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-js)
* [Dart (Flutter)](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-dart)
* [Android](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-android)
* [Swift](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-swift)
* [Go](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-go)
