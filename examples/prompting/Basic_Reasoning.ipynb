Provide a clear, step-by-step solution:\n\nHere's the solution:\n\n1. **Farmer takes the goat across the river.** (Leaves the wolf and cabbage behind)\n2. **Farmer returns alone.**\n3. **Farmer takes the wolf across the river.** (Leaves the cabbage on the original side)\n4. **Farmer brings the goat back to the original side.** (Leaves the wolf on the other side)\n5. **Farmer takes the cabbage across the river.** (Leaves the goat on the original side)\n6. **Farmer returns alone.**\n7. **Farmer takes the goat across the river.** (Joins the wolf and cabbage)\n\n## 4.
